1. POST a user
2. GET a user(one)
3. GET many users
4. UPDATE user details
5. User login
6. UPDATE user password

while working on this, issue of git commits arose.I commited a readme file on my remote repo and i kept receiving an error every time I wanted to push my code.

#here is the solution

Fetch the remote branch from the origin first.

git fetch origin remote_branch_name

🌐from chatGPT =>git checkout main :Checkout the branch that you want to merge with the remote repository. For example, if you want to merge the "main" branch, run

🌐git merge origin/main:Merge the changes from the remote repository into your local branch using the git merge command:
🌐Replace "main" with the name of the branch in the remote repository that you want to merge.

🌐Resolve any merge conflicts that may arise. Git will automatically attempt to merge the changes, but if there are conflicts, you'll need to manually resolve them. Open the files with conflicts, locate the conflicting sections marked by Git, and modify the code to resolve the conflicts.

🌐Once you've resolved the conflicts, stage the changes by running:git add .

🌐Commit the merged changes with a meaningful commit message:git commit -m "Merge remote repository into local repository"
🌐Finally, push the merged changes to the remote repository:git push origin main
